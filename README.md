# FlowStake Technology: Photo/Video Attestation Requirements

## User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)
- **Capture Interface:** Design an intuitive interface for users to easily capture photos or videos during their activities. This should include a clear, easy-to-use camera functionality within the app.
- **Guided Instructions:** Provide users with clear instructions on how to capture the required evidence. This might include tips on framing, lighting, and specific content that needs to be captured (e.g., a clear view of the userâ€™s face, the activity environment, etc.).
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a feedback mechanism that informs users if their photos or videos meet the required criteria or if they need to retake them.

## Technical Specifications
- **Resolution and Quality:** Set minimum resolution and quality standards for the photos and videos to ensure they are clear and usable for attestation purposes.
- **Format and Compression:** Determine acceptable file formats (e.g., JPEG, MP4) and implement compression algorithms that maintain quality while optimizing file size for efficient upload and storage.
- **Metadata Capture:** Ensure the app captures relevant metadata such as timestamp, GPS coordinates, and device information to accompany each photo or video for verification purposes.

## Security and Verification
- **Encryption:** Use end-to-end encryption to secure the photos and videos during upload and storage, ensuring that they cannot be tampered with.
- **Watermarking:** Implement digital watermarking to embed user-specific information within the photos or videos, making it difficult to use fraudulent media.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Store the attestation data on a distributed ledger (e.g., Hedera Hashgraph) to provide a tamper-proof record of the evidence. Each entry should include a hash of the photo or video file and its metadata.

## Data Storage and Management
- **Cloud Storage:** Utilize scalable cloud storage solutions (e.g., Firebase) to handle the large volume of media files. Ensure the storage system can handle peak loads during events.
- **IPFS Integration:** Use InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized media storage. IPFS allows for efficient and distributed storage of media files, ensuring data is accessible and resilient.
- **Hash-Addressable Content:** Ensure all media files stored in IPFS are hash-addressable, meaning each file is referenced by its unique cryptographic hash. This guarantees data immutability and integrity, as any change in the file content will result in a different hash.
- **Retention Policies:** Define data retention policies to manage the lifecycle of the media files, including how long they will be stored and when they will be archived or deleted.
- **Access Control:** Implement strict access control measures to ensure that only authorized users can view or manage the attestation files.

## Attestation Process
- **Real-time Uploads:** Enable real-time uploading of photos and videos during the activity to provide immediate proof of participation and minimize post-activity fraud.
- **Peer Review System:** Allow for a peer review system where users can verify each other's submissions, enhancing community trust and engagement.
- **Automated Verification:** Develop algorithms to perform initial automated checks on the media files, such as verifying GPS data against the activity route or detecting signs of manipulation.

## User Notifications and Feedback
- **Upload Confirmation:** Notify users once their media files have been successfully uploaded and verified.
- **Verification Status:** Provide real-time updates on the verification status of their submissions, including any issues that need to be addressed.
- **Community Feedback:** Implement a system for users to receive feedback from peers and the platform on the quality and authenticity of their submissions.

## Compliance and Legal Considerations
- **Privacy Policies:** Ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR by clearly communicating how user data will be used, stored, and protected.
- **User Consent:** Obtain explicit consent from users for capturing and storing their media files as part of the attestation process.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Establish procedures for users to dispute verification results or raise concerns about privacy and data security.

## Integration with Other Features
- **Activity Feed:** Integrate the attested photos and videos into a social feed within the app, allowing users to share their achievements and engage with the community.
- **Smart Contracts:** Use Ethereum smart contracts to facilitate and enforce sports betting competitions, ensuring that the results based on attested activities are transparent and fair.

## IPFS for Media Storage and Hash-Addressable Content for Data Immutability
- **Decentralized Storage:** Leverage IPFS to store media files in a decentralized manner. This ensures high availability and resistance to censorship.
- **Content Hashing:** Utilize content hashing to ensure that each file can be uniquely identified and verified. The hash serves as a unique fingerprint for the file.
- **Data Integrity:** Guarantee data integrity by ensuring that any alteration in the media file changes its hash, thereby making tampering easily detectable.
- **Interoperability:** Ensure that the IPFS-stored media files can be accessed and verified across different systems and platforms, promoting interoperability and transparency.

By meeting these requirements, FlowStake technology can create a robust, secure, and user-friendly system for photo and video attestation, enhancing the credibility and engagement of the platform.
