# FlowStake Technology: Photo/Video Attestation Requirements

## User Interface and Experience (UI/UX)
- **Capture Interface:** Design an intuitive interface for users to easily capture photos or videos during their activities. This should include a clear, easy-to-use camera functionality within the app.
- **Guided Instructions:** Provide users with clear instructions on how to capture the required evidence. This might include tips on framing, lighting, and specific content that needs to be captured (e.g., a clear view of the userâ€™s face, the activity environment, etc.).
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a feedback mechanism that informs users if their photos or videos meet the required criteria or if they need to retake them.

## Technical Specifications
- **Resolution and Quality:** Set minimum resolution and quality standards for the photos and videos to ensure they are clear and usable for attestation purposes.
- **Format and Compression:** Determine acceptable file formats (e.g., JPEG, MP4) and implement compression algorithms that maintain quality while optimizing file size for efficient upload and storage.
- **Metadata Capture:** Ensure the app captures relevant metadata such as timestamp, GPS coordinates, and device information to accompany each photo or video for verification purposes.

## Security and Verification
- **Encryption:** Use end-to-end encryption to secure the photos and videos during upload and storage, ensuring that they cannot be tampered with.
- **Watermarking:** Implement digital watermarking to embed user-specific information within the photos or videos, making it difficult to use fraudulent media.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Store the attestation data on a distributed ledger (e.g., Hedera Hashgraph) to provide a tamper-proof record of the evidence. Each entry should include a hash of the photo or video file and its metadata.

## Data Storage and Management
- **Cloud Storage:** Utilize scalable cloud storage solutions (e.g., Firebase) to handle the large volume of media files. Ensure the storage system can handle peak loads during events.
- **Retention Policies:** Define data retention policies to manage the lifecycle of the media files, including how long they will be stored and when they will be archived or deleted.
- **Access Control:** Implement strict access control measures to ensure that only authorized users can view or manage the attestation files.

## Attestation Process
- **Real-time Uploads:** Enable real-time uploading of photos and videos during the activity to provide immediate proof of participation and minimize post-activity fraud.
- **Peer Review System:** Allow for a peer review system where users can verify each other's submissions, enhancing community trust and engagement.
- **Automated Verification:** Develop algorithms to perform initial automated checks on the media files, such as verifying GPS data against the activity route or detecting signs of manipulation.

## User Notifications and Feedback
- **Upload Confirmation:** Notify users once their media files have been successfully uploaded and verified.
- **Verification Status:** Provide real-time updates on the verification status of their submissions, including any issues that need to be addressed.
- **Community Feedback:** Implement a system for users to receive feedback from peers and the platform on the quality and authenticity of their submissions.

## Compliance and Legal Considerations
- **Privacy Policies:** Ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR by clearly communicating how user data will be used, stored, and protected.
- **User Consent:** Obtain explicit consent from users for capturing and storing their media files as part of the attestation process.
- **Dispute Resolution:** Establish procedures for users to dispute verification results or raise concerns about privacy and data security.

## Integration with Other Features
- **Activity Feed:** Integrate the attested photos and videos into a social feed within the app, allowing users to share their achievements and engage with the community.
- **Smart Contracts:** Use Ethereum smart contracts to facilitate and enforce sports betting competitions, ensuring that the results based on attested activities are transparent and fair.

By meeting these requirements, FlowStake technology can create a robust, secure, and user-friendly system for photo and video attestation, enhancing the credibility and engagement of the platform.
